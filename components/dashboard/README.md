```

## Requirements Implemented

- **7.1, 7.2**: Query and display sent messages with status
- **7.3, 7.4, 7.5**: Calculate and update message status in real-time
- **8.1, 8.2**: Query and display received messages with status
- **8.3, 8.4, 8.5**: Track unlocked messages and update status
- **11.4**: Responsive grid layout for mobile and desktop

## Status Calculation

Message status is calculated based on:

1. **Locked**: Current time < unlock timestamp
2. **Unlockable**: Current time >= unlock timestamp AND not yet unlocked
3. **Unlocked**: Message has been decrypted and viewed by recipient

Status updates automatically every 10 seconds to reflect time-based changes.

## LocalStorage

Unlocked message IDs are stored in localStorage under the key `lockdrop_unlocked_messages` to persist unlock state across sessions.
