## Automated Checks

### Console Logs to Monitor

Open browser DevTools (F12) and watch for these logs:

**Wallet Connection:**

```
[WalletProvider] Restoring previous connection
[WalletProvider] Successfully connected: 0x...
```

**Storacha Connection:**

```
Storacha: Attempting to restore space: did:...
Storacha: Space restored successfully
Storacha: Connection restored successfully
```

### localStorage Inspection

Check these keys in DevTools > Application > Local Storage:

```javascript
// Should exist after wallet connection
localStorage.getItem("lockdrop_wallet_connection");
// Expected: {"wasConnected":true}

// Should exist after Storacha auth
localStorage.getItem("lockdrop_storacha_auth");
// Expected: {"isAuthenticated":true,"email":"user@example.com","spaceDid":"did:..."}
```

## Performance Checks

### Page Load Time

- **Before fix:** ~3-5 seconds (with reconnection popups)
- **After fix:** ~1-2 seconds (silent reconnection)

### User Actions Required

- **Before fix:** 3-5 wallet approvals per session
- **After fix:** 1 wallet approval (first time only)

## Regression Tests

### Ensure These Still Work

1. **Message Creation:**
   - Can create time-locked messages
   - Encryption works correctly
   - Upload to IPFS succeeds

2. **Message Unlocking:**
   - Can unlock messages after time
   - Decryption works correctly
   - Media playback works

3. **Dashboard:**
   - Shows sent messages
   - Shows received messages
   - Status updates correctly

## Bug Reporting Template

If you find issues, report with this format:

```
**Scenario:** [Which test scenario]
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1.
2.
3.

**Expected Behavior:**
[What should happen]

**Actual Behavior:**
[What actually happened]

**Console Errors:**
[Any errors from DevTools console]

**localStorage State:**
[Contents of lockdrop_* keys]

**Browser:** [Chrome/Firefox/etc + version]
**Wallet:** [Talisman/MetaMask + version]
```

## Success Criteria

All scenarios should pass with:

- ✅ No unnecessary reconnection prompts
- ✅ Clear status indicators
- ✅ Helpful error messages
- ✅ State persists across sessions

- ✅ No console errors

## Notes

- Test in both Chrome and Firefox
- Test with both Talisman and MetaMask
