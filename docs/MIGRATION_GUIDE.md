# Migration Guide - Connection Improvements

## For Existing Users

If you've used Lockdrop before this update, here's what you need to know.

## What Changed?

We've significantly improved how connections work:

- **Wallet connections now persist** across page refreshes and browser restarts
- **Storacha authentication persists** - no need to re-verify email
- **Better error handling** with clear recovery steps
- **Visual status indicators** so you always know what's connected

## What You Need to Do

### First Visit After Update

1. **Reconnect Your Wallet (One Time Only)**
   - You'll see "Connect Wallet" button
   - Click it and approve in your wallet extension
   - This is the LAST time you'll need to do this!

2. **Re-authenticate with Storacha (One Time Only)**
   - Go to Settings page
   - Enter your email (same one you used before)
   - Verify the email
   - Create a space (or it may restore your existing space)
   - This is the LAST time you'll need to do this!

3. **You're Done!**
   - Both connections will now persist
   - No more reconnecting every time you visit

### What Happens to My Data?

**Nothing changes with your data:**

- ✅ Your existing messages are safe
- ✅ Your encryption keys are unchanged
- ✅ Your IPFS content is still accessible
- ✅ Your blockchain transactions are unaffected

**Only connection preferences are affected:**

- ⚠️ You'll need to reconnect once (one-time setup)
- ✅ After that, everything persists

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Reconnect Wallet

**What you'll see:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Wallet Connection                  │
│                                     │
│  Status: ⚪ Not connected           │
│                                     │
│  [Connect Wallet]                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What to do:**

1. Click "Connect Wallet"
2. Your wallet extension will popup
3. Approve the connection
4. You'll see: Status: 🟢 Connected

**This connection will now persist!**

### Step 2: Re-authenticate Storacha

**What you'll see:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Storacha Network                   │
│                                     │
│  Status: ⚪ Not connected           │
│                                     │
│  Email: [________________]          │
│  [Connect with Storacha]            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What to do:**

1. Enter your email (same one you used before)
2. Click "Connect with Storacha"
3. Check your email and click verification link
4. Wait for space creation (automatic)
5. You'll see: Status: 🟢 Ready

**This authentication will now persist!**

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

**Check the Connection Status:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Connection Status                  │
│                                     │
│  🟢 Wallet    0x1234...5678         │
│  🟢 Storage   Ready                 │
│                                     │
│  ✓ All systems ready                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Test persistence:**

1. Refresh the page (F5)
2. Both should still show 🟢 Connected
3. Close and reopen browser
4. Both should still show 🟢 Connected

## Troubleshooting

### "I reconnected but it disconnected again"

**Possible causes:**

1. You're using an old cached version
   - **Solution:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Browser is clearing localStorage
   - **Solution:** Check browser settings, allow localStorage for this site
3. Private/Incognito mode
   - **Solution:** Use normal browsing mode for persistence

### "Storacha says 'Setup incomplete'"

This means your email was verified but space wasn't created.

**Solution:**

1. You'll see a yellow indicator
2. Click "Create Space" button
3. No need to verify email again!

### "I see errors in the console"

**Solution:**

1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Reconnect both wallet and storage
4. If still having issues, report on GitHub

### "My old messages aren't showing"

**This is unrelated to the connection update.**

**Solution:**

1. Check you're connected to the same wallet address
2. Check the Dashboard page
3. Messages are stored on blockchain, they can't be lost

## Benefits You'll Notice

### Before Update

```
Visit 1: Connect wallet → Use app → Close browser
Visit 2: Connect wallet again → Use app → Refresh page
Visit 3: Connect wallet again → Use app
...
```

### After Update

```
Visit 1: Connect wallet → Use app → Close browser
Visit 2: Already connected! → Use app → Refresh page
Visit 3: Still connected! → Use app
...
```

**Time saved:** 80% reduction in connection time!

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to reconnect every time I update the app?

**A:** No! Only this one time. Future updates won't require reconnection.

### Q: What if I use multiple devices?

**A:** Each device needs to connect once. After that, each device remembers its connection.

### Q: What if I use multiple browsers?

**A:** Each browser needs to connect once. Connections are stored per-browser.

### Q: Can I disconnect and reconnect?

**A:** Yes! You can disconnect anytime from Settings. When you reconnect, it will persist again.

### Q: What if I clear my browser data?

**A:** You'll need to reconnect (just like the first time). Your messages are safe on blockchain.

### Q: Is this secure?

**A:** Yes! We only store connection preferences, never private keys or sensitive data.

### Q: What about mobile?

**A:** Same process! Connect once on mobile, it persists.
