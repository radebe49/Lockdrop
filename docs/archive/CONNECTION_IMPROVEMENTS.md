# Connection Flow Improvements

## Problem Summary

The application had a poor UX loop where:

1. Wallet connections didn't persist across page refreshes
2. Storacha authentication flow was fragile and broke easily
3. Users had to reconnect multiple times unnecessarily
4. No clear visibility into connection status

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Wallet Connection Persistence

**Before:** Wallet connection was cleared on every page load for "security"

**After:**

- Wallet connection state is now persisted in localStorage
- On mount, the app attempts to restore the previous connection using `eth_accounts` (doesn't trigger popup)
- Only prompts user if no previous connection exists
- Connection state is saved after successful connection

**Files Changed:**

- `lib/wallet/WalletProvider.tsx`

**Key Changes:**

```typescript
// Now saves connection state
localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify({ wasConnected: true }));

// Attempts silent reconnection on mount
const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_accounts" });
```

### 2. Storacha Authentication Recovery

**Before:**

- Email verification and space creation happened in one atomic flow
- If anything broke, user had to start over
- No way to resume partial authentication

**After:**

- Authentication state is saved at each step
- If email is verified but space creation fails, user can retry just the space creation
- Connection status is verified on mount
- Clear UI states for: not authenticated, authenticated but no space, fully ready

**Files Changed:**

- `lib/storage/StorachaService.ts`
- `components/storage/StorachaAuth.tsx`
- `hooks/useStoracha.ts`

**Key Changes:**

```typescript
// Save state immediately after email verification
this.authState = { isAuthenticated: true, email };
this.saveAuthState();

// New method to check connection status
async checkConnection(): Promise<{
  canRestore: boolean;
  needsSpace: boolean;
  needsAuth: boolean;
}>
```

### 3. Connection Status Visibility

**Before:** No clear indication of what was connected

**After:**

- New `ConnectionStatus` component shows both wallet and storage status
- Visual indicators (green/yellow/gray dots) for each connection
- Clear messages about what needs attention
- Integrated into settings page

**Files Added:**

- `components/storage/ConnectionStatus.tsx`

**Files Changed:**

- `app/settings/page.tsx`

### 4. Improved Error Handling

**Before:** Generic error messages, unclear what went wrong

**After:**

- Specific error messages for each failure mode
- Helpful suggestions for recovery
- Partial state preservation for retry

## User Flow Improvements

### First Time Setup (Happy Path)

1. User connects wallet → Connection persists ✓
2. User authenticates with Storacha email → Email saved ✓
3. User creates space → Ready to upload ✓

### Recovery Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Page Refresh

- **Before:** Lost wallet connection, had to reconnect
- **After:** Wallet automatically reconnects, no user action needed

#### Scenario 2: Email Verified but Space Creation Failed

- **Before:** Had to re-verify email and start over
- **After:** Shows "Complete Storacha Setup" UI with just space creation button

#### Scenario 3: Browser Closed and Reopened

- **Before:** Lost all connection state
- **After:** Both wallet and Storacha connections restored automatically

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Wallet Persistence:**
   - Connect wallet
   - Refresh page
   - Verify wallet is still connected without popup

2. **Storacha Recovery:**
   - Start email authentication
   - Close browser during email verification
   - Reopen and verify you can continue from where you left off

3. **Connection Status:**
   - Check settings page shows accurate status
   - Verify status updates when connections change

### Edge Cases to Test

- Network interruption during authentication
- Multiple browser tabs open
- Wallet extension disabled/enabled
- Invalid email addresses
- Space creation timeout

## Technical Details

### localStorage Keys

- `lockdrop_wallet_connection` - Wallet connection state
- `lockdrop_storacha_auth` - Storacha authentication state

### State Management

- Wallet state: React Context (WalletProvider)
- Storacha state: Singleton service with localStorage persistence
- Both states are checked and restored on mount

### Security Considerations

- Wallet connection uses `eth_accounts` for silent reconnection (no private keys stored)
- Storacha uses UCAN delegation (no API keys in localStorage)
- Both connections require user approval on first connect

## Future Improvements

1. **Connection Health Monitoring:**
   - Periodic checks to verify connections are still valid
   - Auto-reconnect on network recovery

2. **Multi-Account Support:**
   - Remember last used account per wallet
   - Quick account switching

3. **Connection Presets:**
   - Save multiple Storacha spaces
   - Switch between different configurations

4. **Offline Mode:**
   - Queue operations when offline
   - Sync when connection restored

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. Existing users will:

- Need to reconnect wallet once (will persist after that)
- Need to re-authenticate with Storacha once (will persist after that)
- See improved UX immediately after reconnection
